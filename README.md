# tau_eff_study for 2017 mutau channel

The scripts are all in src directory. I use runAnalyzer.sh to test run localy and submit_signal_zprime.sh for submitting whole set of jobs on condor.

The make_eff_plots.py is used for making plots.


src/selections.h has all the selections and filling of histograms.
